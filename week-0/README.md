## What do I need to understand?

All of this can be very overwhelming, so we've written down a small paragraph on what we expect all of you to know beforehand so you can verify for yourself whether you're comfortably prepared.

We'll be building a visualization using _HTML_ and _CSS_. Both of these languages are paramount for this course. If you have no prior experience with these, we highly recommend you follow the above links to study. You don't have to be fluent, we're neither, and Googling solutions is literally our full time job description. We expect you to understand basic *syntax* and *semantic meaning* of HTML tags. As well as a basic *seperation of concerns* and *structure*.

For _JavaScript_, we'll assume you know how to embed a JavaScript file in your HTML and interact with the *DOM* (document object model). You're able to listen to *events*, such as a user clicking on a button, and handle those events in the JavaScript file. Some syntax knowledge here is required, such as knowing how to *declare variables* and *assign values* to them, as well as basic usage of *functions*

_Git_ and _GitHub_ are our means of *version control*. We can save versions of every state the code is in using the Git software. Git keeps a memory of every version the code was in between *commits*. We expect you to be able to use Git, as well as GitHub, to manage your code. Don't worry if the *terminal* is a bit scary, we'll do fine if you're using a *GUI* or Github Desktop.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to send us a message so we can direct specific guidance.
