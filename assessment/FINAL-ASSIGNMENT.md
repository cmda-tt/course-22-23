# Final assignment

> For your final assignment, you'll be creating an *interactive data visualization* using *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*. That's it, that's the assignment.

## Description

The Tech-Track final assessment is an *individual*, *oral* test in which you demonstrate your interactive data visualization, can elaborate and defend design choices, and explain rationale behind the chosen stack or technical solutions.

### What?

* A dashboard, or an experience, or both. You've build a website in the broadest sense possible that conveys knowledge by parsing data and visualizing it.
* Documentation. A clear readme with the who-what-where of your website, installation instructions and external requirements. In addition, a wiki documenting your progress and proces. Including (sketch)notes of all guest lectures and documented choices based on valid research.

### When?

Your deadline is the _thursday_ of _week 6_ at _23:59_. All orals are on Friday

### Where?

You hand in a `.zip` file (the one you can download from GitHub) on [DLO](https://dlo.mijnhva.nl/d2l/home/437179). This contains all your documentation (wiki) and work (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). In addition, the website you've created is live and accesible for your teachers without the need to download something or run a local server.

## Requirements

*General*

* Your website is handed in on DLO, is live on the internet for teachers to access and your GitHub contains a wiki with your process report.
* Your deliverables have been handed in before the agreed upon deadline, which is the day before your oral assessment at 23:59.
* Your code is clean, structured and contains no errors or bugs.
* You've made sketchnotes / a report regarding the guest lectures, or have documented an article you've previously checked with a teacher

*Architecture*

* You're using at least one source of data.
* You've either documented the process of transforming / cleaning this data, or have written code that enables you to parse the data before using it in the website
* You're using at least one (non-micro) library or framework, and utlize this in a useful manner.

*Visualization*

* You've created a _customized data visualization_ using your own data, a sample bar chart does not count. This can be a proof of concept, and doesn't have to be included in your final project.
* Users are able to interact with your visualization, and change / update the dataset to alter it.
* You've chosen relevant means of visualizing your data. Applicable graphs and/or illustrations have been used for the appropriate type of data and you're able to explain your choices and provide alternatives.

*Storytelling*

* You're telling a story. Your application converts data to information and knowledge to provide the user with wisdom (DIKW pyramid).
* You're make use of key elements, such as transitions, animations, navigation or others to provide the users in a narrative experience.
* The goal of your application is specified for the target audience you're serving.

*Wiki*

* Your wiki contains the instructions for a peer to download, run and deploy your application.
* Your wiki contains the research conducted in order to create your application, this includes the required data(sets), examples of similar or interesting existing visualizations and sketches of your own concept.
* Your wiki lists the resources used in your application.
* Your wiki contains a (weekly or daily) log of activities.
* Your wiki contains a reflection on your delivered work, a "what could have gone better" and "where am I proud of?".
